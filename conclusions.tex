\chapter{Conclusions and outlook}
\label{sec:conclusions1}


Currently all experimental studies in particle physics are in agreement with a set of theories called the Standard Model (SM).  
However, from the cosmological and other observations, as well as the internal consistency checks, the SM is found to be an incomplete theory. Thus it is believed to be an effective theory of a more fundamental theory. 
There are many models predicting physics beyond-SM, but so far none of them have been
corroborated by experimental results.

 This thesis describes several searches for the signatures of models of beyond-SM physics.  A common feature of these searches is that their experimental signature is a pair of energetic jets (back-to-back in detector), one or both of which are characterized by the internal jet structure (``substructure").

The jet substructure arises when the W/Z (V) or Higgs (H) boson is at a large Lorentz boost and the hadronization products from its decay 
(${\rm W/Z \to qq'}$, $\Hbb$, or ${\rm H \to WW^* \to qqqq}$) merge into a single jet. 
Thus the jet from W/Z or Higgs decay has several cores of energy. In contrast, the main source of background --  the QCD production -- formed by the hadronization of a quark or a gluon, does not possess the jet substructure.  
 

The analysis of the substructure is based on several aspects sensitive to the difference between signal and background:
\begin{itemize}
   \item pruned jet mass (removing soft and wide-angle radiations) : in the process of jet pruning, the QCD jets lose a lot of mass, 
   whereas the bulk of the mass of W/Z/H jets is mostly preserved. 
   \item N-subjettiness (Equation~\ref{eq:nsub}) is small if the jet is N-prong. Different ratios of N-subjettiness variables are chosen and optimized for different signals. 
   \item subjet b tagging:  for $\Hbb$, we search for b hadron decays in subjets. 

\end{itemize}
   


\section{Conclusions for ${\rm X \to qV~or~VV}$ analysis}

An inclusive sample of multijet events corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of \intlumi, collected in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=8$\TeVcc with the CMS detector, is used to measure the
$\PW/\cPZ$-tagged dijet mass spectrum for the two leading jets,
produced within the pseudorapidity range $|{\eta}| < 2.5$ with a
separation in pseudorapidity of $|{\Delta\eta}| < 1.3$. The generic
multijet background is suppressed using jet-substructure tagging
techniques that identify vector bosons decaying into $\qqbarprime$ pairs
merged into a single jet. In particular, the invariant mass of pruned
jets and the $N$-subjettiness ratio $\tau_{21}$ of each jet are used
to reduce the initially overwhelming multijet background. The
remaining background is estimated through a fit to smooth analytic
functions. 

With no evidence for a peak on top of the smoothly falling
background, lower limits are set at the 95\% confidence level on
masses of excited quark resonances decaying into qW and qZ at 3.2 and
2.9 TeV, respectively. Randall--Sundrum gravitons \GRS decaying into
WW are excluded up to 1.2 TeV, and $\PWpr$ bosons decaying into
$\PW\cPZ$, for masses less than 1.7 TeV.  

For the first time mass
limits are set on $\PWpr\to \PW\cPZ$ and \GRS $\to \PW\PW$ in the
all-jets final state. 
%The mass limits on $q^*\to q\PW$, $q^*\to
%q\cPZ$, $\PWpr\to \PW\cPZ$, \GRS$\to \PW\PW$ are the most stringent
%to date.  
A model with a ``bulk'' graviton $\GBulk$ that decays into
WW or ZZ bosons is also studied, but no mass limits could be set due
to the small predicted cross sections.

\section{Conclusions for ${\rm X \to VH}$ analysis}
A search for a massive resonance decaying 
into a standard model-like Higgs boson and a W or Z boson is presented.
A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \intlumi
collected in proton-proton 
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV with the CMS detector
has been used to measure the W/Z and Higgs boson-tagged 
dijet mass spectra
using the two highest $\pt$ jets within the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| <
2.5$ and with pseudorapidity separation $|\Delta\eta| < 1.3$.  The QCD
background is suppressed using 
 jet substructure tagging techniques,
which identify boosted bosons decaying into hadrons.  In particular, 
the mass of pruned jets and the $N$-subjettiness ratios
$\tau_{21}$ and $\tau_{42}$, as well as b tagging applied to the subjets
of the Higgs boson jet, are used to discriminate
against the otherwise overwhelming QCD background.  The remaining QCD
background is estimated from a fit to the dijet mass distributions using a smooth function. 

We have searched for the signal as a peak on top of the smoothly
falling QCD background.  No significant signal is observed. 
In the HVT model B, 
a ${\rm Z'}$ is excluded in resonance mass intervals [1.0, 1.1] and 
[1.3, 1.5] TeV, while a ${\rm W'}$ is excluded in the interval [1.0, 1.6] TeV.  
A mass degenerate 
${\rm W'}$ plus ${\rm Z'}$ particle is excluded in the interval [1.0, 1.7] TeV.  

This is the first search for heavy resonances decaying into
a Higgs boson and a vector boson (W/Z) 
resulting in a hadronic final state,
as well as the first application of jet substructure techniques
to identify 
$\Hww$ decays of the Higgs boson at high Lorentz boost.

\section{Outlook}

The most recent ATLAS search for a ${\rm X \to VV}$ resonance shows an
 evidence of about 3$\sigma$ 
excess at the dijet invariant mass of 2 TeV in Figure~\ref{fig:atlasvv}.

\label{fig:atlasvv}
\end{figure}
Similar effects were also observed in our own VV analysis, but with a smaller excess of 1.3 sigma at
1.9 TeV shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Vtagresults2}. 

At the end of Run I, there are 
hints, but no statistically significant proof of new physics at $\sim$2 TeV scale.
In 2015, the center-of-mass collision energy at the LHC will reach 13 TeV, with a high 
luminosity. For ${\rm X \to VV}$ or ${\rm X \to HV}$, the cross section is expected 
to go up $\sim$30--70 times, but for QCD only by $\sim$2--3 times compared to now. 
 With more events, we will verify the bump as of just a statistical fluctuation or a 
discovery of beyond-SM physics. 
 
The discovery of the Higgs boson was a tremendous success of the hard work of thousands of physicists and engineers for the past 30 years. 
However, it is not the end, for about 96\% of 
the universe (dark matter, dark energy) is beyond the SM and our current understanding. 
We hope that we are at the beginning of a new era in particle physics, where the data from the LHC can be mined in the years to come and used to flesh out the outlines of the theory that underlies the SM.
