\begin{abstract}
Two searches for massive resonances decaying into qV/VV/VH final states are presented, in which V is for W, Z bosons, while H is for Higgs boson. 

The data analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7~fb$^{-1}$ collected by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV.
The cutting edge jet substructure algorithms are used to distinguish V and H boson jets from the standard model QCD quark/gluon jets background.

Exclusion limits are set at a confidence level of 95\% on the production cross sections of: (i) excited quark resonances q* decaying to qW and qZ for masses less than 3.2 TeV and 2.9 TeV, respectively, (ii) a Randall–Sundrum graviton \GRS decaying into WW for masses below 1.2 TeV, and (iii) a heavy partner of the W boson W? decaying into WZ for masses less than 1.7 TeV. 
In HVT model scenario B, resonance masses are excluded for W’ in the interval [1.0, 1.6] TeV, 
for Z’ in the intervals [1.0, 1.1] and [1.3,1.5] TeV, and for mass- degenerate W’ and Z’ in the interval [1.0, 1.7] TeV.
Amodel with a “bulk” graviton $\GBulk$ that decays into WW or ZZ bosons is also studied.

They don't speak English, and they barely know what I'm studying on.
