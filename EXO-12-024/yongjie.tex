% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.
\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
%\abstract{ We report on a search for massive resonances decaying into a quark and
%  a vector boson, qW or qZ, or a pair of vector bosons, WW, WZ, or ZZ,
%  where each vector boson decays into hadronic final states.  This
%  search has been performed on the proton-proton collision data collected
%  with the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012 at a center-of-mass
%  energy of 8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
%  19.7/fb.
%  The boosted vector bosons are identified using novel jet
%  substructure identification techniques.  Excited quark resonances
%  decaying into qW (qZ) are excluded up to 3.17 TeV (2.88 TeV).  A
%  Randall-Sundrum graviton is excluded up to 1.24 TeV
%  assuming decay into WW. A heavy partner of the SM W boson W'
%  decaying into WZ is excluded in the ranges 1.00-1.23, 1.39-1.52 and 1.57-1.61 TeV.}

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
