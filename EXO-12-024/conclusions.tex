\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \intlumi
collected in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$\TeVcc with the CMS detector
has been used to measure the $\PW/\cPZ$-tagged dijet mass spectrum using
the two leading jets within the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 2.5$
and with pseudorapidity separation $|\Delta\eta| < 1.3$.  
The QCD
background is suppressed using jet substructure tagging techniques,
which identify vector bosons decaying into hadrons.  In particular,
we use the invariant mass of pruned jets and the $N$-subjettiness
ratio $\tau_{21}$ to discriminate against the initially overwhelming 
QCD background.  The remaining QCD background is estimated from a 
fit to the smooth parameterized shape.  We have searched for the signal 
as a peak on top of the smoothly falling QCD background.
No evidence has been found for new resonance production in the $\PW/\cPZ$-tagged dijet
spectrum.  A 95\% CL lower limit is set on the mass of excited quark
resonances decaying into qW (qZ) at 3.17 (2.88) TeV.  $G_{RS}$
decaying into WW is excluded up to 1.24 TeV.  W'
decaying into WZ is excluded in the ranges $[1.00,  1.23]$,  $[1.39,  1.52]$ and $[1.57,  1.61]$ TeV.
