\section{Trigger}
\label{sec:trigger}


Events are selected if one of the following triggers has fired: HLT\_HT750, HLT\_PFHT650, HLT\_PFNoPUHT650
HLT\_FatDiPFJetMass750\_DR1p1\_Deta1p5.  All versions of each of these triggers is used. None of these triggers are prescaled druing the 2012 data taking period. HLT\_PFNoPUHT650 trigger is used for the data set after the RunC(including RunC), while HLT\_PFHT650
trigger is only used for RunA and RunB data sets. 


Figure ~\ref{fig:trigger efficiencies part1}, Figure ~\ref{fig:trigger efficiencies part2} and Figure ~\ref{fig:trigger efficiencies part3} shows the trigger efficiencies of the OR of the highest threshold HLT\_PFHT650 trigger and the HLT\_FatJetMass trigger w.r.t. an OR of the lower threshold HLT\_HT550 trigger. From the plot, the trigger is $99\%$ effiecient above $890 GeV$ for the untagged, single tagged and double tagged data.
