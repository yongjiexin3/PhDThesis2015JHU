\section{Systematic uncertainties for HbbZqq search}
\label{sec:systematics}
The sources of systematic uncertainties are summarized as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Background-related systematic uncertainties: background parametrization.
\item Signal-related systematics uncertainties: H/W/Z-tagging efficiency, b tagging scale factor uncertainty, Jet Energy Scale(JES), Jet Energy Resolution(JER), luminosity.
\end{itemize}





\subsection{ B tagging scale factor and uncertainties}
We use the 1c method recommended by the BTV group,
%here \hyperref[bSF]{''https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagSFMethods\#1c\_Event\_reweighting\_using\_scale''}
here \hyperref[bSF]{"https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagSFMethods\#1c\_Event\_reweighting\_using\_scale"}
When dR of the fat jet in $[0.3, 0.4]$, we will double the b tagging scale factor uncertainties. 
And the b tagging SF uncertainties are calculated conservatively as the largest difference in tagging efficiency 
for different signal resonance masses. 

{\bf we could show the b tagging SF factor up and down distribution for signals. Although the uncertainties are not 
applied as a shape variable.}

%\subsection{Another Background shape parametrization}

%Here we use a mistag rate based background estimation method. 
%We get the mistag rate in the side band, which is the rate of jet QCD jet tagged as a
%higgs jet. And then we apply this Higgs mistag rate back into the Z signal region.
