\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
A search for a massive resonance decaying 
into a standard model-like Higgs boson and a W or Z boson is presented.
A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \intlumi
collected in proton-proton 
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$\TeVcc with the CMS detector
has been used to measure the W/Z and Higgs boson-tagged 
dijet mass spectra
using the two highest $\pt$ jets within the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| <
2.5$ and with pseudorapidity separation $|\Delta\eta| < 1.3$.  The QCD
background is suppressed using 
 jet substructure tagging techniques,
which identify boosted bosons decaying into hadrons.  In particular, 
the mass of pruned jets and the $N$-subjettiness ratios
$\tau_{21}$ and $\tau_{42}$, as well as b tagging applied to the subjets
of the Higgs boson jet, are used to discriminate
against the otherwise overwhelming QCD background.  The remaining QCD
background is estimated from a fit to the dijet mass distributions using a smooth function. 
We have searched for the signal as a peak on top of the smoothly
falling QCD background.  No significant signal is observed. 
In the HVT model B, 
a Z' is excluded in resonance mass intervals [1.0, 1.1] and 
[1.3, 1.5] TeV, while a W' is excluded in the interval [1.0, 1.6] TeV.  
A mass degenerate 
W' plus Z' particle is excluded in the interval [1.0, 1.7] TeV.  

This is the first search for heavy resonances decaying into
a Higgs boson and a vector boson (W/Z) 
%resulting in an all-jets final state,
resulting in a hadronic final state,
as well as the first application of jet substructure techniques
to identify 
$\Hww$ decays of the Higgs boson at high Lorentz boost.
