% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
%  This is a search of massive resonannce decaying into Higgs and a vector boson,
%   where each boson decays into hadronic final states.  This
%  search has been performed on the proton-proton collision data collected
%  with the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012 at a center-of-mass
%  energy of 8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
%  19.7/fb.
%  The boosted vector bosons are identified using novel jet
%  substructure identification techniques. The Higgs bosons are identified by different 
%  techniques with respect to different decay channels. Higgs decays to b quarks are identified by 
%  b-tagging on the two subjets. While Higgs to WW to qqqq quarks are identified by N-subjettiness.  
  A search for massive resonances decaying into a
   Higgs boson (125 GeV) and a W or a Z boson is reported.
  The analysis is
  performed on an inclusive sample of multijet events corresponding to
  an integrated luminosity of 19.7\fbinv,  collected in
  proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV with
  the CMS detector at the LHC. %The Higgs bosons are identified by different 
  %techniques with respect to different decay modes. 
  Jets from Higgs decaying into
  $b$-quark pairs are identified by subjets/jets $b$-tagging.
  The search also uses jet-substructure
  identification techniques that provide sensitivity to the presence of
  highly boosted Higgs bosons decaying into hadronic W pairs and vector bosons
  decaying into a pair of quarks.
%  Limits are setting on W' and Z' bosons, decaying into one Higgs boson and 
%  one vector boson. We exclude Z' resonances up to mass of 1.3TeV. 
  Exclusion limits are set at a confidence level of 95\% on the production of %: 
  Z' decaying into HZ for masses in [1.0, 1.1] TeV and [1.3, 1.5] TeV,  and
  W' decaying into HW for masses in [1.0, 1.6] TeV.

% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
