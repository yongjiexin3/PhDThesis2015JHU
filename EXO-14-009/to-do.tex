\section*{To-do list}

This is what still needs to be added to the note:

\begin{enumerate}


%\item High priority: the data/MC scale factor for the
%  $\tau_{42}$ cut (and its uncertainty) in $\Hww$ channel.
%  Status: the HERWIG++ samples are in hand, and are being processed.

%\item High priority: figure out how to obtain the theoretical curves
%  for the limit plots.  In fact, these are simplified models and we
%  may need to figure out how to quote the limits.

\item Medium priority: add the description of the simplified models
  into the introduction section.

\item Low priority: Document the study of the impact of changing the value of
  the $\tau_{42}$ cut as a function of the resonance mass.  We decided
  against using this so this is just for completeness.

%\item Low priority: Add to the Appendix the comparison betwen the limits while using
%  CSVL vs CSVM for the fat jet b tagging.

\end{enumerate}
