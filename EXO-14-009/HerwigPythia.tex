\section{tau42 and tau21 uncertainty due to showering}

We study the tau42 and tau21 uncertainties from hadronic showering by comparing the different shower tools,
pythia vs herwig. In Table.~\ref{table:Difference}, we compare 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 TeV signals. The largest difference from HZ high
purity is from 1TeV, which is 13.09\%. And we can also see the difference in Z gen jet tagging efficienciy is larger than that of Higgs gen 
jet tagging efficienciy.
