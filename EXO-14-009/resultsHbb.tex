Figure~\ref{fig:HbbVCombined} shows the limits for \HbbVqq signals passing the 
$\Hbb$ tagger. Limits of combining catogories Hbb1 and Hbb2 are presented. 
The $\Hbb$ and V bosons braching ratios are already taken into account.

 search, in $\Hbb$ decay mode. Branching ratios of $\Hbb$ and V decays are
 taken into account.Theory model used here is HVT scenario B, arXiv:1402.4431.
