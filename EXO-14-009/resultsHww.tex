Figure~\ref{fig:HwwVCombined} shows the cobmined limits for \HwwVqq and \HbbVqq signals failing the 
$\Hbb$ tagger but passing the             
$\Hww$ tagger. Limits of combining category Hww1, Hww2 and Hww3 are presented.
The $\Hww$, $\Hbb$ and V bosons braching ratios are already taken into account.

\caption{Expected and observed limits for ${\rm Z'\to HZ}$(left) and ${\rm W' \to WZ}$(right)
 search for categories Hww1, Hww2 and Hww3. Branching ratios of $\Hww$, $\Hbb$ and V decays are
 taken into account. Theory model used here is HVT scenario B, arXiv:1402.4431.
% The high purity is on the bottom left. the low purity V-tagging on bottom right.
